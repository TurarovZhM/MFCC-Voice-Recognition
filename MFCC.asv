function [ output_args ] = mfcc( SIGNAL, SAMPLERATE )
%   This function contains all modules whith will handle with 
% spectral future extraction problem. Every single weave 
% will go through all extraction steps like
% VAD, preemphasis, filtering, windowing , dfft
% and on the end mel-filterbank which produeces
% feature vector for one frame
%   Input wav signal
